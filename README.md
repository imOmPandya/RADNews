# News Website CMS

Welcome to the News Website CMS, a full Content Management System for a news website. This project is built using HTML, CSS, PHP, and utilizes a MySQL database. The landing page of the website can be accessed at [http://news-site.rf.gd/](http://news-site.rf.gd/).

## Features

- Recently Uploaded Post Section: The landing page displays a section showcasing the most recently uploaded news posts.
- News Section: Users can browse through all the news posts categorized by different categories, such as Sports, Entertainment, and Politics.
- Category-wise Filtering: The website includes a working search bar that allows users to search for news/posts specific to a particular category.
- Admin Dashboard: The project incorporates an admin dashboard accessible at [http://news-site.rf.gd/admin](http://news-site.rf.gd/admin), where authorized users can log in.
- User Management: Two types of users can log in to the admin dashboard: regular users and admins. Regular users can add, delete, edit, and update their own posts. Admins, on the other hand, have additional privileges, including the ability to add, delete, edit, and update any post. They can also browse posts based on categories and manage user roles (normal user or admin).
- Site Customization: The admin dashboard provides an option for admins to customize the website by changing the logo, site name, and footer.
